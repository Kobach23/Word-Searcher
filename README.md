Word-Searcher
=============

A program for solving those pesky word searches.


I made this in my junior year of high school and it was originally required to work with a 5x5 grid and find the start and end 
points of three words. We were given three weeks to complete the original assignment. I finished the requirements in half a week,
and adapted it to work with any size grid within a week. I have since evolved it to it's current form which is also idiot proof.
Included are examples of the word searches and how to format them (grid width followed by grid followed by words to find) as well
as the source code for the original program. Just run it as you would any other java file. It is currently designed to work within
a folder titled "Word-Searcher" within "Program Files" and the word searches themselves are drawn from a subdirectory called 
"Word Searches". Folders are case sensitive and I'm sorry you have to do the setup manually but we weren't taught how to make
.exe or .jar files in my high school class and I haven't been able to figure it out since. Once everything's been set up feel 
free to test your own word searches if you'd like or use it to solve them. Enjoy and message if you have any questions, comments
or concerns.
